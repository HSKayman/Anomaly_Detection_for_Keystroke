# Intern Project: Anomaly Detection through Keystroke & Tap Dynamics

This repository contains the code and resources for an anomaly detection project implemented at Krontech. The project focuses on keystroke and tap dynamics, using machine learning algorithms for detection.

## Project Overview

The product developed through this project has evolved into a service offered by Krontech. It addresses the question of whether employees are using the keyboard themselves on their assigned computers. The system demonstrates robust responsiveness to internal security threats and offers insights into the computer activities of users whose company security is accessed by third-party applications.

## My Role

In my role in this project, the primary objective was to ascertain the feasibility of the concept. I conducted a study involving five individuals, employing machine learning algorithms to validate its functionality. The process spanned two months and involved the following steps:

1. Data collection by recording keyboard activities
2. Data crawling
3. Dataset analysis
4. Creation, training, and testing of a machine learning algorithm

The successful outcome was then presented.

## Future Work

This project is ongoing, and future updates will be committed to this repository as they become available.
